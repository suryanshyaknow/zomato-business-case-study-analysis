    "### Step 1. \n",
    "The very first step of mine would've been to gather data on `Zomato wallet Usage`, more importantly, have a feature indicating the number of repeat orders per user. Since I don't have the data and I am allowed to make any assumptions, so here they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**i.** The very first notion that hits me is the presence of a competitor, say **Swiggy** that had already established its wallet usage in the same region for a long time. Quite evidently, it'd be hard for Zomato to beat that overnight, and it might need an entirely different strategy than it'd need, had it been the pioneer of the wallet in that certain region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ii.** My follow-up assumption would be quite obvious. It's very tempting to assume that with the launch of its wallet, coming along would also be a new UI. Considering the excelling past of Zomato, the customer could've been used to the old UI and would face difficulties operating the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking from personal experience, earlier Zomato used to give a kind of tab of older orders along with a functionality of reordering them from the home page itself, indicating a smoother overall experience. A new UI might not provide users with the same comfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iii.** Another viable assumption can be made on the basis of the age criteria of people living in the considered city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Say, for example, the new city has more proportion of elderly people who might not be acquainted as well as younger ones with the wallet usage. And hence the decrease in the number of repeat orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- And say if the proportion of college students is higher, they might look for other alternatives which also provide some % off on older orders, thus the decrease in the number of repeat orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we can determine the proportion by clustering the users and take action accordingly."

    "### Step 2. \n",
    "Next, I'd derive KPIs -- to measure the performance of the Wallet -- from the aforementioned assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viable **KPIs** for the assumptions that I made:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`Frequency of Transactions`**<br>Measures the number of transactions made using Swiggy's and Zomato's wallet during a given period of time. And as such lower frequencies for Zomato would suggest users' bias towards Swiggy's wallet.<br>Having said that, it's unlikely that Swiggy would share its data with us. Thus, Zomato would need to rely on its own data.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`Average Time Spent on Orders using Wallet (for complete orders)`**<br>If the average time spent on a complete order turns out more for the one placed with wallet than the one placed without it (in the past), it's unlikely that users will adhere to wallet in future.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`Average Time Spent on Orders using Wallet (for incomplete orders)`**<br>This is kinda a decision-oriented KPI. By evaluating the average time spent on an incomplete order, we can directly gain insights into the efficiency and ease of use of the wallet for the users. If it turns out less, then it's likely that the user discarded the transaction due to some technical bug preventing them from making the transaction, and if it's high, then we can make the inference that the user tried their all and at last frustratingly abandoned the transaction. Accordingly, a direct decision can be made from here without any further analyses.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`Customer Churn Rate`**<br>Measures the % of customers who have stopped using Zomato's services altogether. A high churn rate would imply that customers are not at all at ease with using the wallet.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews`**<br>This is kind of too obvious. By doing sentiment analysis user review specifically related to the wallet feature, we can head on gain insights into the user's mind and pinpoint areas that'd need improvement."
